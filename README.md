## Design

As with any band, they are very much identity & brand focused.\
Their image and how it is portrayed is of importance. 

To ensure a unique and a cohesive brand centric identity thoughout the website,\
I used a custom colour palette, produced bespoke artwork and incorporated complementary iconography. 
The artwork created was further incorporated into the merchandise being sold, via the [Merch Page](https://asdub.github.io/yellow-lemon-MP1/merchandise.html).

### Colours
A simple palette of colours was chosen. 

#### Primary Colours
Yellow - *#dfc548*\

Black - *#191919*\

### Wireframes
![mockup](https://github.com/asdub/yellow-lemon-MP1/blob/master/mockups_screenshot.png "Yellow Lemon Logo")
Mobile, Tablet & Desktop mockups  - [View in full here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/17b30f70-61ed-4e79-a028-648b3cdb0ab8-42e0/grid)

A comprehensive set of mock-ups/ wireframes were created.\
Layouts and styling for mobile, tablet & desktop devices.

Mockup/ Wireframe Pages include:
>*Mobile* 
- Home 
- Home - Band News section
- Home - Events Section 
- Home - Follow Section
- Menu Overlay
- The Band
- Merchandise
- Band News Article 
- Getting in Touch / Private Events 

>*Tablet*
- Home 
- Studio Sessions 

>*Desktop*
- Home - including Band News Section
- Home - Events Section
- Home - Follow Section
- The Band
- Studio sessions
- Merchandise
- Band News Article 
- Getting in Touch / Private Events 

I didn't create mockups for each device variation.\
The mockup content produced reflects the layouts and styling applied throughout the site. 

**Production Design Changes to Note** 
- Initially, I was planning on having only two news articles on mobile layout, a further news page 
containing a number of recent articles and a further page for individual articles.\
This was amended, the live mobile site now only shows text articles, removing the images allowed
for four articles to be placed in the same space. Negating the need for a dedicated page to list recent news articles. 
On larger dispalys such as tablets and desktops the article images will appear. 
- Black was used instead of red for article headings. Due to contrast issues against a white background. 

### Typography

This website uses both [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Adobe Typekit](https://fonts.adobe.com/). 

The Google font in use:\
**Roboto** \
<img src="https://github.com/asdub/yellow-lemon-MP1/blob/master/readme/screenshots/roboto.png" width="150" alt="Google Fonts - Roboto" />

The Adobe Typekit font in use:\
**Effra** \
<img src="https://github.com/asdub/yellow-lemon-MP1/blob/master/readme/screenshots/effra.png" width="150" alt="Adobe Typekit - Effra" />

**Rockwell** \
<img src="https://github.com/asdub/yellow-lemon-MP1/blob/master/readme/screenshots/rockwell.png" width="150" alt="Adobe Typekit - Rockwell" />

### Responsive Design 
Yellow Lemon was designed as a mobile first website. 

Rather than use a framework, I decided to use [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout).\
This allowed me to create a besoke layout while still being easily adaptable to various screen sizes, thanks to extensive configurability afforded by grids. 

There are three distinct layouts: 
* Mobile - Default
* Tablet - Displays wider than 768px
* Large Tablet/ Small desktop - Displays wider than 992px
* Desktop -  - Displays wider than 1200px

Testing the responsiveness of the webiste is condected in the [testing section](#testing) below. 





### Summary
 The site meets the aims of both user & client.<br>
 Through a heavily brand focused theme and experience, users can view informaiton on band members, 
 both their history and the groups. And view upcomming events. <br>

 The client will be able to showcase their latest tracks via a Spotify popup.<br> 
 Provide fans with details on their [upcomming events](https://asdub.github.io/yellow-lemon-MP1/#events), with external links to booking partners.<br> 
 And an area to showcase their [latest merchandise](https://asdub.github.io/yellow-lemon-MP1/merchandise.html) for sale. <br>

 While not on the orginal brief, a dedicated area - [Sessions](https://asdub.github.io/yellow-lemon-MP1/sessions.html)
 for the group to keep in touch and their fans updated during lockdown.

### Frameworks
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is the the only external library used. 

Layouts were created using CSS Grid. 

### Testing
- All links on the site have been tested. 
- Menu and popups checked on mobile & desktop. 
- Site viewed in mobile, tablet, deskop resolutions with different aspect ratios to confirm layout rendering. 
- HTML & CSS validated with W3C Validator. 

<p>
    <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer">
        <img style="border:0;width:88px;height:31px"
            src="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/images/vcss-blue"
            alt="Valid CSS!" />
    </a>

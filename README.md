### Design & Planning
![logo](https://github.com/asdub/yellow-lemon-MP1/blob/master/yellow-lemon-logo-small.png "Yellow Lemon Logo")
<br>
<br>
Rather than use a framework, I decided to use CSS grids in order to create a unique experience for the user. 
The site is meant to create an easy to use and playful envirmoment for fans to enjoy client content. 
While at the same time providing the client with a platform to showcase their latest music, advertise their 
events and sell theiur merchandise.

### Summary
 The site meets the aims of both user & client.<br>
 Through a heavily brand focused theme and experience, users can view informaiton on band members, 
 both their history and the groups. And view upcomming events. <br>

 The client will be able to showcase their latest tracks via a Spotify popup.<br> 
 Provide fans with details on their [upcomming events](https://asdub.github.io/yellow-lemon-MP1/#events), with external links to booking partners.<br> 
 And an area to showcase their [latest merchandise](https://asdub.github.io/yellow-lemon-MP1/merchandise.html) for sale. <br>

 While not on the orginal brief, a dedicated area - [Sessions](https://asdub.github.io/yellow-lemon-MP1/sessions.html)
 for the group to keep in touch and their fans updated during lockdown.

### Frameworks
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is the the only external library used. 

Layouts were created using CSS Grid. 

### Testing
- All links on the site have been tested. 
- Menu and popups checked on mobile & desktop. 
- Site viewed in mobile, tablet, deskop resolutions with different aspect ratios to confirm layout rendering. 
- HTML & CSS validated with W3C Validator.

## Design

As with any band, they are very much identity & brand focused.
Their image and how it is portrayed is of high importance. 

To ensure a unique and a cohesive brand centric identity throughout the website,\
I used a custom colour palette, produced bespoke artwork and incorporated complementary iconography. 
The artwork created was further incorporated into the merchandise being sold, via the [Merchandise Page](https://asdub.github.io/yellow-lemon-MP1/merchandise.html).

### Colours
A vivid palette of colours was chosen. 

#### Primary Colours
Yellow - *#dfc548*\
![Yellow](https://github.com/asdub/yellow-lemon-MP1/blob/master/readme/screenshots/colours/yellow.png "Yellow - #dfc548")

Black - *#191919*\
![Black](https://github.com/asdub/yellow-lemon-MP1/blob/master/readme/screenshots/colours/black.png "Black - #191919")

Red - *#f87b70*\
![Red](https://github.com/asdub/yellow-lemon-MP1/blob/master/readme/screenshots/colours/red.png "Red - #f87b70")

Off White - *#fafafa*\
![Off White](https://github.com/asdub/yellow-lemon-MP1/blob/master/readme/screenshots/colours/off-white.png "Off White - #fafafa")

White - *#ffffff*\
![White](https://github.com/asdub/yellow-lemon-MP1/blob/master/readme/screenshots/colours/white.png "White - #ffffff")

#### Secondary Colours

Spotify Green - *#1db954*\
![Spotify Green](https://github.com/asdub/yellow-lemon-MP1/blob/master/readme/screenshots/colours/green.png "Spotify Green - #1db954")


### Wireframes
![mockup](https://github.com/asdub/yellow-lemon-MP1/blob/master/mockups_screenshot.png "Yellow Lemon Logo")
Mobile, Tablet & Desktop mockups  - [View in full](https://xd.adobe.com/view/17b30f70-61ed-4e79-a028-648b3cdb0ab8-42e0/grid).

A comprehensive set of mock-ups/ wireframes were created.
Layouts and styling for mobile, tablet & desktop devices.

Mockup/ Wireframe Pages include:
>*Mobile* 
- Home 
- Home - Band News section
- Home - Events Section 
- Home - Follow Section
- Menu Overlay
- The Band
- Merchandise
- Band News Article 
- Getting in Touch / Private Events 

>*Tablet*
- Home 
- Studio Sessions 

>*Desktop*
- Home - including Band News Section
- Home - Events Section
- Home - Follow Section
- The Band
- Studio sessions
- Merchandise
- Band News Article 
- Getting in Touch / Private Events 

I didn't create mockups for each device variation.
Aspects of both the mobile and desktop design are applied to tablet layouts.  

**Production Design Changes to Note** 
- Initially, I was planning on having only two news articles display on the home page, a further news page 
containing a number of recent articles and a further page for individual articles.\
This was amended, the live mobile site now only shows text articles, removing the images allowed
for four articles to be placed in the same space. Negating the need for a dedicated page to list recent news articles. 
On larger displays such as tablets and desktops the article images will appear. And the image size and amount of initial copy was reduced. 
- Black was used instead of red for article headings. Due to contrast issues against a white background. 

### Typography

This website uses both [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and [Adobe Typekit](https://fonts.adobe.com/). 

The Google font in use:\
**Roboto** \
<img src="https://github.com/asdub/yellow-lemon-MP1/blob/master/readme/screenshots/roboto.png" width="100" alt="Google Fonts - Roboto" />

The Adobe Typekit font in use:\
**Effra** \
<img src="https://github.com/asdub/yellow-lemon-MP1/blob/master/readme/screenshots/effra.png" width="100" alt="Adobe Typekit - Effra" />

**Rockwell** \
<img src="https://github.com/asdub/yellow-lemon-MP1/blob/master/readme/screenshots/rockwell.png" width="100" alt="Adobe Typekit - Rockwell" />

The following font-weights were used:\
100, 400, 500 & 700.


### Iconography

A custom icon was used for the events alert:\
<img src="https://asdub.github.io/yellow-lemon-MP1/assets/svg/covid.svg" width="65" alt="Coronavirus Icon">

All other icons in this project are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

The following Font Awesome icons have been used:\
<img src="https://github.com/asdub/yellow-lemon-MP1/blob/master/readme/icons_fa.png" width="450" alt="Font Awesome Icons">

*Used on the Get in Touch Page/ Private Events:*\

<img src="https://asdub.github.io/yellow-lemon-MP1/assets/svg/merch-tshirt.svg" width="150" alt="Merchandise Tshirt">


### Responsive Design 
Yellow Lemon was designed as a mobile first website. 

Rather than use a framework, I decided to use [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout).\
This allowed me to create a bespoke layout while still being easily adaptable to various screen sizes, thanks to extensive configurability afforded by grids. 

There are three distinct layouts: 
* Mobile 
    - Default
* Tablet 
    - Displays wider than 768px
* Large Tablet/ Small desktop 
    - Displays wider than 992px
* Desktop 
    - Displays wider than 1200px

Testing the responsiveness of the website is conducted in the [testing section](#testing) below.

## Testing

### Automated Testing
**[WC3 HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fasdub.github.io%2Fyellow-lemon-MP1%2F)**\
**Results**
- No errors or warnings to show.

**[WC3 CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fasdub.github.io%2Fyellow-lemon-MP1%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)**\
**Results**
- No errors (CSS level 3 + SVG)

**[JS Hint](https://jshint.com/)**\
**Results**\
*menubar.js*\
One warning:
- [ ] Missing semicolon (line 29).

*menuoverlay.js*\
Five warnings:
- [ ] Missing semicolon (line 7, 29, 30, 31).
- [ ] Expected an assignment or function call and instead saw an expression (line 9).
- [ ] Missing semicolon (line 29).
- [ ] Two undefined variables {'spotify' line 8 & 41} + {'headphones' line 9 & 14}.
- [ ] Three unused variables {menuOverlay line 12} + {menuUnderlay line 34} + {spotifyOverlay line 40}.

As JS is not a requirement of MP1, and these warnings are not having a huge impact on site functionality.
I will apply fixes at a later date. I have noted the likely effect these errors are causing in the [known bugs section](#known-bugs) below.

I was unable to test Internet Explorer. \
As I am using CSS Grids, it's assumed the site will render incorrectly if viewed via Internet Explorer.

[Can I Use It](https://caniuse.com/) was used extensively during production of the CSS grid layout to ensure support accross all modern web browsers. 


**Results Noted:**\
The site behaved well on almost all display sizes.\
Some issues were found on larger tablet display sizes where the news article image becomes stretched. 
I have noted this in the [known bugs section](#known-bugs) below.
